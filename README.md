This is a simple API error class that helps create an instance of custom API errors. It was created as a support package for [@respondex/core](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/respondex).

## Documentation
Along with [@respondex/core](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/respondex), a class has been provided that can be used to better handle errors that may occur during runtime; be it client or server errors. By simple instantiating an error object with this class, you can send a well formated http response using the RespondEx **error** method. Simply pass the instantiated error object as the first parameter of the **error** method.

```
import RespondEx from "@respondex/core";
import ApiError from "@respondex/apierror";

  'Product not found',
